## swaySmartTitle.py

Hide titlebar every time there is only one window on the workspace. This is beta version, that mostly works.

### Requirements

* sway (obviously)

### Limitations
* sometimes the script fails to restore titlebar when a second window is added to the workspace.
* not tested with tabbed/stacked containers
